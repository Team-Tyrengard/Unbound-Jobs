  # XP decay is designed to balance the job level across players,
  # depending on whether they actively do tasks for the job or not.
  # XP decay happens per decay cycle, which can be set in the config.
  #
  # A quota is set for each job for each player, depending on the player level.
  # It follows the formula: xp_decay_quota = base_quota + (player_job_level * level_quota)
  #
  # If a player does NOT meet the decay quota for a job during a decay cycle,
  # the player's XP for that job will decay, following the formula below:
  # xp_after_decay = current_xp - (base_rate + (player_job_level * level_rate))
  #
  # If you want to turn off XP decay for a job, set all values below to 0.
